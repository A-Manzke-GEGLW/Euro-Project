    <h1>Where to start?</h1>
    <p>Where can we start? over the years, the CIA, KGB, MI6, Mossad, etc. (take your pick) have all had some pretty insane ideas. ranging from simply moving ICBM's to Cuba, <br>
      potentially causing the biggest nuclear scare in all of history, to Project Acoustic Kitty, which is where we'll start.</p>
    <h2>Project Acoustic Kitty</h2>
    <p>When you think of how you can ruin a childs dreams and immagination, this should come to the forefront of you brain. They did many things to a poor kitty in the name of reconassaince. <br>
      the general premise of the project was to train a cat to listen into a conversation between any two soviet officials, allowing the US to learn all the juicey gossip the Soviets had to offer. <br>
      heres what they decided to do.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Basically Skin a cat alive</li>
      <li>install some top of the line listening and recording devices under the cats skin</li>
      <li>sew it back up, and send it to the streets of moscow, <br>
        of course after extensive training on how to y'know...walk up to and listen inconspicuously to a bunch of specific people</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Obviously, this didn't work at all. It was unbelievbly hard to train a cat to actually listen and activly want to be around tons of different people for all of 10 seconds. <br>
    lThis led to the cat being released for its first mission, because the CIA was grosly over budget with the project, mand placed in the moscow streets. <br>
    It lasted a whole 10 seconds before being run over, ending project Acoustic Kitty at that instant</p>
